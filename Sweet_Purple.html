<h3 id="description-">Description:</h3>
<p>This is a pepper created by Giancarlo Fadda by crossing a White Chupetinho with a Pink Reaper.  These are a great small pod pepper with some nice heat and a great taste with some sweetness.  Pods have a very nice shape and grow on a dark foliage plant.   This pheno is unique in that it does not change color much and remains mostly purple when ripe.  The only way I was able to determine ripeness was by checking for soft pods on the plant.  Very productive.  The filial generation of these is uncertain, you may see some variations from this description.</p>
