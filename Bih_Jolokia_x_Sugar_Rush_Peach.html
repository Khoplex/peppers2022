<h4 id="bohica-pepper-hut">Bohica Pepper Hut</h4>
<p>This is a cross between a Bih Jolokia and a Sugar Rush Peach.  Fruits are 3 to 4 inches in length and a very pretty cream colored orange.  Very sweet flavor and not to hot but still a good amount of slow building heat.  The plants are very prolific producers of pods.</p>
<h4 id="white-hot-peppers">White Hot Peppers</h4>
<p>This is an outstanding cross.  Most people thought it was one of the fruitiest peppers they have tried.  Heat is habanero level or a little above to me.  Plants are super productive, just loaded up with bright orange pods.  The filial generation of these is unknown and therefore must be considered unstable.  Your grow results could vary from this description.</p>
