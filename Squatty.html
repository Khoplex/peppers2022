<h3 id="description-">Description:</h3>
<p>This is a great pepper.  My ability to come up with good names for new strains is, well, horrible to say the least.  I called this squatty because it has always been and extremely short plant for me.  It has never grown above 2 feet tall yet, but tends to grow laterally a good amount.  Even though small it is quite productive.  This was born from some 7 Pot Orange seeds I received from another vendor years ago.  These are more like a habanero and no where near the heat you would expect from a 7 pot.  The pods to me are more of a yellow, but could also be a light orange to golden color.  The pods tend to be a very nice size and have a really good heat, more than a normal habanero and a nice strong citrus flavor to them.  These are one of my favorites and one I would likely grow every year if I was just growing for my own use.  They have been quite stable since I first grew them years ago with minimal variation.   </p>
