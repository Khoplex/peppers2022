<h3 id="description-">Description:</h3>
<p>This is one of my favorites.  Has a great citrus flavor and is very hot.  They don&#39;t look like much, but the heat is was very impressive, at least a split between the Fatalii and Yellow Brain Strain if not leaning more towards the brain strain heat.  I got the seeds for these from my friend Jeff Hobbs, who told he he received his from our friend Dave Schram who I believe is the creator of this strain.  The filial generation of these is unknown and therefore must be considered unstable. Your grow results could vary from this description.</p>
