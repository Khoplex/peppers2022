<h3 id="description-">Description:</h3>
<p>The Bubblegum 7 pod is a chili pepper from Jon Harper in the UK. It’s also known as Bleeding Bubblegum or BBG7 and is a cross between a Trinidad Morouga Scorpion and Yellow 7 pod pepper.  Jon called it Bubblegum because he thought it had a taste of the Bubbaliscious Bubblegum.  The thick over-sized calyx turned red “bleeding” when pods are left on the plants for longer times.  The 7 Pot Bubblegum pepper is not yet entirely stable.  </p>
