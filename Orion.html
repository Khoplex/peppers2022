<h3 id="description-">Description:</h3>
<p>This is a cross created by Rocco Maltesi originally called Fatalli Gourment Jigsaw x Big Red Mama x Yaki Blue Fawn.  These grow big purple / dark plants and are one of the most striking peppers visually you can grow. The filial generation of these is unknown and therefore must be considered unstable.  Your grow results could vary from this description.</p>
