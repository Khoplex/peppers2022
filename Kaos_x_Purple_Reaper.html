<h3 id="description-">Description:</h3>
<p>A very nice cross between KAOS and Purple reaper.  The pods are shaped much like the KAOS, only bigger.  They get the early coloring of the Purple Reaper in that the early pods start off all purple on the sun facing side before ripening to red.  They are very tasty and extremely hot.  A nice clean taste with no floral or bitterness.  They are extremely productive and have some pretty gnarly shapes.   Plants have quite a bit of purple influence in the foliage.  The filial generation of these is F2 and therefore must be considered unstable. Your grow results could vary from this description.</p>
